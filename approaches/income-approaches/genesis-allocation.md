# Genesis allocation

A genesis allocation means that at the beginning of the network a percentage of the total coin supply will be allocated to the ecosystem's treasury. The founding entities might have full control over how these coins get used in the short and medium term. Over the long term the coins will either be allocated towards different initiatives that get funded or the stewardship over the remaining coins will usually be pushed towards the community so that they can govern how the remaining coins get used rather than centralised actors. A genesis treasury allocation can help with bootstrapping the ecosystem by funding different protocols and applications that bring new use cases to the network. These initiatives could help with generating more demand for the network. Some ecosystems might decide to try and manage these assets over a much longer time horizon by only using a small percentage of the allocation each year to help fund ecosystem initiatives.



**Very high short term income potential (Score - 5)**

A genesis allocation of coins dedicated to supporting the ecosystem's development would mean that funds would be quickly available from the start of the network's launch. These coins could then be used to help with maintaining and improving the network. Coins might gradually become available based on a defined release schedule.



**Very low long term income potential (Score - 1)**

A genesis allocation does not provide any future income streams for the ecosystem's treasury. The genesis allocation of treasury assets could have a long term impact if they are slowly used over time however this approach does not generate future income.



**Very low incentive complexities (Score - 5)**

The allocated genesis assets could be used for any impactful initiatives that require funding. There arenâ€™t any obvious incentive complexities as these assets have been allocated before the launch of the network and set aside for this specific purpose for the benefit of the wider ecosystem. These assets are not being taken from anyone and the source of the income would also not be influenced by certain community members more than any others. All coin holders of the network could participate in determining how the genesis assets are used if governance control is pushed towards the community.



**Very low malicious actor risks (Score - 5)**

The genesis assets are already pre-determined prior to the launch of the network. The assets are then available for the ecosystem to use to maintain and improve the network and wider ecosystem.



**Very low transaction deadweight loss (Score - 5)**

The allocated genesis coins for the treasury are already pre-determined prior to the launch of the network. This allocation should not have any impact on reducing the number of transactions that get submitted on the network.



**Total score = 21 / 25**
